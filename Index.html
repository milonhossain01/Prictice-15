        I'm sorry to hear that you're feeling this way. It's important to reach out to friends, family, or a mental health professional for support. They can provide a listening ear and guidance during difficult times. Additionally, consider engaging in activities that usually bring you joy, practicing self-care, and focusing on your well-being. If your feelings persist or worsen, seeking professional help is crucial. Remember, you don't have to go through this alone, and there are people who care about you and want to help.</p>
